change ${name_for_run} for the name you want

change $random_name to specify the dirname where randoms are stored
currently I have:
chunk25: chunk25_randoms
sgc:     sgc_brick_dat2

make a 'UnprocessedBricks.txt' in the folder:
/global/cscratch1/sd/huikong/obiwan_Aug/repos_for_docker/obiwan_code/py/obiwan/Drones/obiwan_analysis/preprocess/brickstat/${name_for_run}/
to specify the bricks needs to be processed

currently using 25 nodes, 16 threads in each node
